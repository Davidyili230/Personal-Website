                    <p>Hi, my name is Yi Li, and I‚Äôm currently a junior at CUNY Hunter College pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I recently completed a CodePath course that introduced me to web development, and I immediately found a passion for designing and bringing ideas to life online.</p>

                    <p>This website marks the beginning of my journey to becoming an expert in web development. I'm also currently building another site to showcase menu items and share the story behind a local bubble tea shop.

                <!-- Why named David -->

                    <hr class="extra-line">
                    <h2 id="Question">Why I'm I known as David?</h2>
                    <p>The name "David" came from an unexpected place‚Äîmy mom‚Äôs American friend. Curious how? Back in elementary school, both students and teachers constantly mispronounced my real name, "Yi." Instead of saying "Ee," everyone said "Yee." Frustrated, I told my mom about it. A few days later, she was chatting with her American friend when she mentioned how simple his name, David, was to pronounce. And just like that, David became my nickname.</p>
                    <hr class="extra-line">
                    <p>What‚Äôs funny is how far the name stuck. In high school, whenever a new class or teacher came along, I‚Äôd introduce myself as David right away. It became second nature‚Äîsoon, everyone knew me as David. Then came graduation. As people flipped through the yearbook looking for my profile, they suddenly realized something shocking. My legal name is Yi Li. People were genuinely freaking out. Some had known me for years and never knew David wasn‚Äôt my real name.</p>
                    <hr class="extra-line">
                    <p>The best part? One of my closest friends‚Äîsomeone I‚Äôd known since I was 10‚Äîdidn‚Äôt find out my real name until we were 17.</p>

                            <p><strong>April 17, 2025</strong> ‚Äî I hiked the full loop of Bull Hill, a 1,400 ft mountain (though I still don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs called a hill). My friend and I started early, and it took us about 2 hours and 30 minutes to reach Cold Spring. The uphill portion alone took nearly 2 hours and covered about a third of the entire trail.
                                It was only my second time hiking a mountain, but this one was way more exhausting than my first. Reaching the peak was unforgettable ‚Äî I had never seen a mountain skyline before, and the view was absolutely breathtaking.
                                The descent took another 2 hours. My legs were aching so badly by the end that I could barely walk. We finally took an 8-minute break just before finishing the trail, completely worn out but proud.

                            <p><strong>Every now and then on Saturdays,</strong> my friends and I take a drive into the city to vibe, snap some pics for the memories ‚Äî and yeah, for the 'gram too. We just enjoy the ride, the views, and the little convos that make it all feel easy.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p><strong>August 1, 2024</strong> four of us ‚Äî three friends and me ‚Äî took a 2-day, 1-night trip to Kalahari Resort. We drove 3 hours, and it was our first trip together. We made the most of every moment. We stopped at Walmart for late-night snacks (and, of course, barely ate half of what we bought). 
                                Everyone was hyped for the rides, and we kicked things off with the 7ft drop ride. One of our friends almost drowned, which was scary at first but turned into a joke we still laugh about. We hit the Jacuzzi, lazy river, wave pool, and a bunch of other rides.
                                At night, we got into some trouble with a little ding-dong ditching, got caught, and were banned from leaving our room. Safe to say, we won‚Äôt be doing that again! Later, my friends wanted to watch The Nun (horror movie based on a true story), but I knocked out halfway through. It wasn‚Äôt super scary, though. Overall, it was an awesome experience, and we‚Äôre thinking about doing something similar next summer.
