            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Yi Li, and I’m currently a junior at CUNY Hunter College pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I recently completed a CodePath course that introduced me to web development, and I immediately found a passion for designing and bringing ideas to life online.</p>
            <hr class="extra-line">
            <p>This website marks the beginning of my journey to becoming an expert in web development. I'm also currently building another site to showcase menu items and share the story behind a local bubble tea shop. I'm eager to keep learning—every day I'm improving my HTML/CSS, JavaScript skills, and exploring SQL to create more dynamic, interactive websites.</p>

            <!-- Why I'm known as David -->
            <hr class="extra-line">
            <h2 id="Question">Why am I known as David?</h2>
            <p>The name "David" came from an unexpected place—my mom’s American friend. Curious how? Back in elementary school, both students and teachers constantly mispronounced my real name, "Yi." Instead of saying "Ee," everyone said "Yee." Frustrated, I told my mom about it. A few days later, she was chatting with her American friend when she mentioned how simple his name, David, was to pronounce. And just like that, David became my nickname.</p>
            <hr class="extra-line">
            <p>What’s funny is how far the name stuck. In high school, whenever a new class or teacher came along, I’d introduce myself as David right away. It became second nature—soon, everyone knew me as David. Then came graduation. As people flipped through the yearbook looking for my profile, they suddenly realized something shocking. My legal name is Yi Li. People were genuinely freaking out. Some had known me for years and never knew David wasn’t my real name.</p>
            <hr class="extra-line">
            <p>The best part? One of my closest friends—someone I’d known since I was 10—didn’t find out my real name until we were 17.</p>
