                <p>Hi, my name is Yi Li, and I’m currently a senior at CUNY Hunter College pursuing a degree in Computer
                    Science. I took a web development course outside of school and enjoyed this new language I learned,

                <hr class="extra-line">
                <p>This website marks the beginning of my journey to becoming an expert in web development. I'm also
                    currently building another site to showcase menu items and share the story behind a local bubble tea
                    shop. I'm eager to keep learning—every day I'm improving my HTML/CSS, JavaScript skills and

            <!-- Why named David -->

                <hr class="extra-line">
                <h2 id="Question">Why I'm I known as David?</h2>
                <p>The name "David" came from an unexpected place—my mom’s American friend. Curious how? Back in
                    elementary school, both students and teachers constantly mispronounced my real name, "Yi." Instead
                    of saying "Ee," everyone said "Yee." Frustrated, I told my mom about it. A few days later, she was
                    chatting with her American friend when she mentioned how simple his name, David, was to pronounce.
                    And just like that, David became my nickname.</p>
                <hr class="extra-line">
                <p>What’s funny is how far the name stuck. In high school, whenever a new class or teacher came along,
                    I’d introduce myself as David right away. It became second nature—soon, everyone knew me as David.
                    Then came graduation. As people flipped through the yearbook looking for my profile, they suddenly
                    realized something shocking. My legal name is Yi Li. People were genuinely freaking out. Some had
                    known me for years and never knew David wasn’t my real name.</p>
                <hr class="extra-line">
                <p>The best part? One of my closest friends—someone I’d known since I was 10—didn’t find out my real
                    name until we were 17.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>August 10, 2025</strong> — I met up with two of my best friends from high school. It
                            had been four years since we last saw each other. Both of them looked different from how I
                            remembered them. We went to Raising Cane’s together, catching up on everything from
                            education to work to relationships. We talked like we were back in high school.
                            After going to the library and Petco, we got desserts and then went our separate ways. We
                            hope to see each other soon.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>July 24, 2025</strong> — This time, I joined two friends on a challenging hike of the
                            entire 1,473-foot Bear Mountain. We opted for the same route as the Cold Spring train but
                            got off a few stops early. The mountain was a two-hour drive from the station, and we were
                            confident that we could complete a 2.5-hour walk to the mountain, a 5-hour trail, and then
                            another 2.5-hour walk back.

                            However, our plans took an unexpected turn. About 30 minutes into our hike, we noticed that
                            the only route to the summit was closed due to construction. Undeterred, we decided to take
                            a Lyft to the starting point. From there, we had lunch and set off on our adventure.

                            Everything went smoothly until we reached the 30-minute mark. It became increasingly
                            difficult for me to keep up with my two friends. The trail was much steeper than Bull Hill,
                            and after two hours, we had reached the peak, having completed one-third of the loop.
                            Exhausted, we knew we had to continue.

                            My leg began to ache, just like it had on my first hike, and my two friends were also
                            experiencing discomfort. We stumbled upon two straight sticks lying on a tree, as if someone
                            had placed them there knowing we were in trouble. At this point, we were at the two-thirds
                            mark of our journey.

                            As we descended, we lost our way, navigating a trail where the tracks became increasingly
                            difficult to see. Suddenly, we spotted deer, and at that moment, we realized that it had all
                            been worth it. We had 15 minutes left to reach our destination.

                            We kept walking until we noticed a bright light coming in the distance. We had made it! We
                            left the sticks on a sign, hoping that someone in need would find them. It was a truly
                            memorable hike, and we were all proud of completing the most challenging route.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>April 17, 2025</strong> — I hiked the full loop of Bull Hill, a 1,400 ft mountain
                            (though I still don’t understand why it’s called a hill). My friend and I started early, and
                            it took us about 2 hours and 30 minutes to reach Cold Spring. The uphill portion alone took
                            nearly 2 hours and covered about a third of the entire trail.
                            It was only my second time hiking a mountain, but this one was way more exhausting than my
                            first. Reaching the peak was unforgettable — I had never seen a mountain skyline before, and
                            the view was absolutely breathtaking.
                            The descent took another 2 hours. My legs were aching so badly by the end that I could
                            barely walk. We finally took an 8-minute break just before finishing the trail, completely
                            worn out but proud.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>August 1, 2024</strong> — four of us — three friends and me — took a 2-day, 1-night
                            trip to Kalahari Resort. We drove 3 hours, and it was our first trip together. We made the
                            most of every moment. We stopped at Walmart for late-night snacks (and, of course, barely
                            ate half of what we bought).
                            Everyone was hyped for the rides, and we kicked things off with the 7ft drop ride. One of
                            our friends almost drowned, which was scary at first but turned into a joke we still laugh
                            about. We hit the Jacuzzi, lazy river, wave pool, and a bunch of other rides.
                            At night, we got into some trouble with a little ding-dong ditching, got caught, and were
                            banned from leaving our room. Safe to say, we won’t be doing that again! Later, my friends
                            wanted to watch The Nun (horror movie based on a true story), but I knocked out halfway
                            through. It wasn’t super scary, though. Overall, it was an awesome experience, and we’re
                            thinking about doing something similar next summer.
